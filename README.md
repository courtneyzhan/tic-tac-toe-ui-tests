# README
This is a public version of [my private thesis repository](https://github.com/courtneyzhan/practical-mobile-test-automation-with-appium) to be attached to my thesis submission.

This repository contains the Functional UI E2E tests developed in my honours thesis for the Android & iOS Tic Tac Toe apps.

My thesis supervisor A/Prof. Guangdong Bai already has access to the private repository. If you would like to access to the private repository, please email me at <courtneyzhan@icloud.com>, I will respond within 24 hours. The private repository includes pre-compiled versions of the iOS and Android apps, commit history of the test files and the BrowserStack compatible versions of the test files (note: the BrowserStack copies were omitted from this repository for convenience, as they can be quite easily replicated following the conversion example in my thesis).
